# Housing_price_predictionHousing Price Prediction
Project Overview
The Housing Price Prediction project aims to predict housing prices based on various features using a machine learning model. This project utilizes a RandomForest model to analyze and predict the prices of houses based on features such as location, size, and number of rooms. Additionally, a web application is built using Flask, HTML, and CSS to provide an interactive interface for making predictions.

**Objective**
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for housing prices and create a web application that allows users to input house features and obtain price predictions. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and web development.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project includes various features related to housing characteristics. Typical features in the dataset might include:

longitude
latitude
housing_median_age	
total_rooms	
total_bedrooms	
population	
households	
median_income	
median_house_value	
ocean_proximity



**Model Building**
RandomForest Model
The RandomForest model is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and robustness. The model is trained on the housing dataset to predict house prices based on the provided features. Key steps include:

**Feature Selection:** Identifying relevant features for the model.
Training: Fitting the RandomForest model to the training data.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Web Application
The web application is built using Flask and provides an interface for users to input house features and receive price predictions. The application includes:

**Frontend:** Developed with HTML and CSS to create a user-friendly interface.
Backend: Flask handles user input, interacts with the trained RandomForest model, and provides predictions.
Frontend (HTML & CSS)
The frontend consists of HTML forms and CSS styling to create an intuitive interface where users can enter house features and submit their information. The HTML forms collect user inputs, while CSS styles the application to ensure a clean and responsive design.

**Backend (Flask)**
Flask is used to manage the application's backend logic, including:

Handling User Input: Receiving input from the HTML form.
Model Integration: Loading the trained RandomForest model and using it to make predictions based on user input.
Displaying Results: Providing the predicted house price to the user.
Usage
To use the housing prediction web application:

**Set Up the Environment:** Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Flask Application: Start the Flask server by running python app.py.
Access the Application: Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to use the application.
Input Features: Enter house features into the form and submit to receive a predicted price.
